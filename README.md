# Spirit11 - Fantasy Cricket League Platform

Spirit11 is a fantasy cricket league platform developed during a 36-hour hackathon as part of the SpiritX 2025 event. The platform allows users to create and manage their dream cricket teams using real university player data. Users can analyze player statistics, manage budgets, and compete on a leaderboard. The platform also features an AI-powered chatbot named "Spiriter" that assists users in making smart team selections.

## Project Overview

The project consists of three main components:

1. **Admin Panel**: For managing players and their statistics.
2. **User Interface**: For team creation and management.
3. **Spiriter Chatbot**: An AI-powered chatbot that assists users in making informed team selections.

       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
       databaseURL: "YOUR_DATABASE_URL",

       messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
       appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
     };
     ```

   - Replace the placeholder values in `src/services/firebase.js` with your Firebase configuration.

### 4. Set Up OpenAI API Key

1. **Get Your OpenAI API Key**:
   - Go to the [OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/).
   - Generate an API key if you don't already have one.

2. **Configure the API Key**:
   - Open the file `src/utils/chatbotUtils.js`.
   - Replace the placeholder with your OpenAI API key:
